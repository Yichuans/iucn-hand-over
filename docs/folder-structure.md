The content is located at [E:\Yichuan](E:\Yichuan), on the workstation (WCMC-PC-01918.internal.wcmc)

Most of my content is organised into folders with the names of collaborators or those who requested help. This is the highest level. Within this level, project files can be found if this is a one-off request; or folders, each representing a single project. 

Folders named *not after* people usually refer to one-off/non-specific, large or recurring projects. Below is a concise explanation of important folders, or those needs clarification:

Admin: 
> all admins, including timesheets, travel authorisations, visas, tickets, cost reclaims and etc

Basedata: 
> most base data are located here (spatial). Typically they include base physical, cultural boundaries, grids, hillshade, ecoregions etc. Recommendation: 

> recommend using esri ArcCatalog to navigate

COM_XXX: 
> preparations for World Heritage Committee meetings

Comparative_analysis_20XX: 
> results of comparative analysis of that year. They will generally include digitised polygons, results of the analysis in tables, and also maps (including map templates that create them)

Dggrid: 
> discrete global hexagon grids program

Documents: 
> unsorted *docx* or *pdf* format documents prior to 2014

Dump_PG: 
> unsorted database dump prior to 2014

Elena: 
> World Heritage Outlook data dumps and analysis files are located

Experiment: 
> test space for various tools, analysis and scripts, unsorted (do not use)

Good_reference_map_collection: 
> a collection of maps for reference

IT: 
> project folder for the first World Heritage Outlook system development 

Landsat_archiving: 
> python based script for the archiving project, superseded by the [near real time Landsat 8 images](http://wh-app.yichuans.me/landsat) in the Lab. (do not use)

Map_templates: 
> outdated template (do not use)

Mapmart: 
> 0.5m resolution WorldView imagery purchased to identify mining activities, in Russia

MyGDB.gdb: 
> a somewhat historic/duplicate place holder for base data, but in esri geodatabase format. It mainly contains biogeographic, broad scale priorities and old site level priorities such as KBA datasets. It also includes world vector shore line data (including EEZs). While I do not recommend using any of the datasets, do not delete this database, as there may be map documents referring to the data here-within 

MyWorkplace.gdb: 
> similar to 'Experiment' folder but in geodatabase format

Papers: 
> feeder folder for Mendeley, the reference management system for papers

Red_List_data: 
> raw Red List data releases from 2013

Remote sensing: 
> test data for raw satellite images (mostly Landsat) collected throughout my time for ad-hoc projects

Scripts: 
> arguably the most important folder. Sub folder structure below

- geoprocessing: 
scripts and libraries for undertaking spatial analysis, generic data analysis, workflow automation etc. See the [geoprocessing](geoprocessing.md) section for more information. This is also backed up on [GitHub](https://github.com/Yichuans/geoprocessing)

- scripts: 
historic place holder for scripts. Most one off, ad-hoc scripts are here.

- mysql20110516: 
outdated SQL scripts for maintaining the PostgreSQL database

sites_improve_geometry_XXX: 
> series of attempts to improve the qualities of WH datasets until 2015

sitesXXXX: 
> digitised boundaries for new nominations, and successful inscriptions and/or modifications. 

TentativeList: 
> outdated tentative list sites improvement (do not use)

Updates: 
> outdated map document to update the database and no longer relevant (do not use)

WDPA: 
> copies of WDPA monthly releases for analysis

WH_benefits: 
> project folder for the first WH benefits analysis

WH_stats: 
> statistics after COM

WHO_geom_updates: 
> methodology for updating the maps in the old WH Outlook system. This may not be relevant any more

WHS.gdb: 
> spatial data for natural and mixed World Heritage sites, in geodatabase format

WHS_arcgisonlineXXX.gdb: 
> spatial data to be zipped and uploaded to the arcgisonline. This is the data behind the [esri feature service](https://wcmc.io/world-heritage-data)

WHS_dump_ATTR: 
> attributes/non spatial data for natural and mixed World Heritage sites

WHS_dump_KML: 
> historical dumps of WH data in KML format, superseded by the feature service

WHS_dump_SHP: 
> shapefile format of the WH data

WHS_map_batcher: 
> map template to automate map production

WHS_quality_check: 
> map comparisons between GIS, official maps from UNESCO, including retrospective ones. The numerous comparisons underpin and empower the systematic check and subsequently the improvement of the data.

Yichuan:
