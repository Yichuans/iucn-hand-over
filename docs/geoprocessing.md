# Introduction

This section explains the *technical* side of my work, on analysis, maps and automation. 

The reason why much of my time has gone into the development, improvement and maintenance of the scripts is simple - next time the same task is requested again, I have an existing method, or previously working solution, that could be re-used or adapted. This saves time and increases my productivity

Wherever possible, I try to automate. In some cases, this obviously represents a poor investment of time, i.e., doing it manually step by step may be quicker. Automation for one-off tasks is over-engineering. I would argue, however, any time spent on making a tool, or spent on mastering a potentially more productive tool is a just investment that brings benefits in the long term. 

For example, the different implementations of the comparative analysis have led to a reduced workload significantly. See below a graph depicting the amount of days to do the spatial overlay between the plethora of datasets and new nominations. This frees time for species richness, irreplaceability, improved maps, just to name a few.

Some of the tasks present similar technical challenges. Especially for frequent, recurring tasks, it is imperative that I develop libraries or templates to minimise repetitive work, and that more time is made available for creative tasks and increased productivity.
