# About 

This is the last project I undertake at IUCN's World Heritage Programme. I intend to document to the best of my knowledge my work in past seven years that my be useful in the future, and also pass necessary information onto the team. Apart from the usual 'where to find things', these will include high-level introductions of past projects, datasets, tools and methodologies, and in some cases with in-depth explanations if such detail is deemed useful and has not been documented elsewhere.

**[INTERNAL USE ONLY!]** 

I choose to use a web format to organise the handover content simply due to the fact that it does a better job in searching. This could be published more widely for easy accessibility, particularly for methodologies that may have a wider use, but I would discourage such use for matters of potential confidentiality.

In terms of content, below is a linked list. You may also use the `search docs` box to locate content using keywords.

1. World Heritage GIS database. This includes, amongst others, the maintenance of the database, its updates, and statistics and export that depend on the database.
2. Comparative analysis. As contrary to the methodology, which has been published as a separate document, will focus on the technical side of the analysis in GIS, should future users require to replicate or improve the semi-automatic process utilised in recent years. 
3. World Heritage analyses initiative. 
4. World Heritage datasheets
5. Folder structure on workstation
6. World Heritage Outlook
7. Geoprocessing methodologies
8. Presentations

I do not intend to duplicate what is being documented elsewhere in greater details for [World Heritage Analysis](http://world-heritage-analyses.iucn.org), alongside their source codes on [GitHub](https://github.com/Yichuans/wh-knowledge-lab).

# Acknowledgement 

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Tim and Naomi for the oversight and mentoring, and for making the secondment arrangement a success. Thanks also go to the two wonderful teams at IUCN and at UNEP-WCMC, and to many colleagues I have worked with in the long seven years. I hope to remain in touch with you all and wish you all the very best in 2018 and onwards.
