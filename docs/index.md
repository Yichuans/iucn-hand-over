# About 

This is the last project I undertake at IUCN's World Heritage Programme. 

I intend to document important work in the past seven years in order to pass on necessary information to the team. Apart from the usual 'where to find things', I also took the liberty to include high-level explanations of current projects, datasets, tools and methodologies, and in some cases with significant details if deemed useful or has not been documented elsewhere.

The reasons I chose to use a web format in organising the handover content are two folds. First and foremost, it does a fabulously better job in searching - with frictionless access, I hope the my handover is not only useful, but **usable and used**. Second, I embrace the idea of [open knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_knowledge) in that the free access to knowledge is a good thing as it benefits all. I will not document any materials in this handover that may be a breach of confidentiality or represent a conflict of interest. My work builds on and benefits from those who share their knowledge in the public domain, and I feel compelled to do the same.

Below shows how content is organised but you may find it easier to use the `search docs` box to locate content using keywords.

1. [World Heritage GIS database](./world-heritage-database.md). This includes, amongst others, the maintenance of the database, updates, and statistics and export that depend on the database.
2. [Comparative analysis](). As contrary to the methodology, which has been published as a separate document, will focus on the technical side of the analysis in GIS, should future users require to replicate or improve the semi-automatic process utilised in recent years. 
3. [World Heritage analyses](./world-heritage-knowledge-lab.md). Originally called the knowledge lab, this initiative aims to create a digital platform where new ideas about knowledge dissemination and presentation can be tried and tested
4. [World Heritage datasheets](./datasheet.md). A descriptive summary of natural World Heritage sites at the time of inscription
5. [Folder structure](./folder-structure.md), on my workstation. It provides a brief explanation on the overall structure, and more importantly on where to find things
6. [World Heritage Outlook](./world-heritage-outlook.md). This flagship project aims to estbalish a proactive monitoring mechanism to improve conservation outlooks. It covers a significant amount of my time and some prototypes in the World Heritage Analyses in fact deliver the activities and tasks required by this project.
7. [Geoprocessing methodologies](./geoprocessing.md). A collection of scripts I developed to automate tasks or increase productivity, such as map batching and parallel computing.
8. [Presentations](./presentation). A collection of recent presentations.


# Acknowledgement 

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Tim and Naomi for their oversight and mentoring, and for making the secondment arrangement a success. Thanks also go to the two wonderful teams at IUCN ([World Heritage Programme](https://www.iucn.org/theme/world-heritage/contact)) and at UNEP-WCMC ([Protected Areas Programme](https://www.unep-wcmc.org/employees#11)), and to many colleagues I have worked with during the long seven years. I hope to remain in touch with you all and I wish you all the very best in 2018 and onwards.
